</p>

<p><span> When writing operation classes, it is recommended to adhere to the best coding practices for Java. </span></p>

<ul>
		<li><span>It is recommended to avoid using multiple System.out.println commands while writing operation classes as this will increase total run time. 
				Users can use Hydrograph’s watchpoint feature for any debugging.</span></li>
			<p> </p>
		<li><span>If users for some reason need to use System.out.println in operation classes, it is recommended to follow below approaches:</span></li>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Should be used during development only. Having System.out.println in production is not recommended at all.</span></li>
				<li><span>It’s usage should be restricted to fields. Printing entire inputRow is not recommended.</span></li>
				<li><span>It’s usage should be restricted to once or twice and that too only for specific fields.</span></li>
			</ul>
			<p> </p>
		<li><span>For every output field, a separate Java class should be written. This helps is tracing the output field all the way to the fields in source. </span></li>
</ul>
