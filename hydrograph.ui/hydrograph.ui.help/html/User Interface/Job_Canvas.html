<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;"><b>Job Canvas</b>&nbsp;is the central space where user can drag components from the component palette and place them in it. Users may also double click on any component for directly placing the component in a free area of the canvas.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Components can be connected by links drawn from their respective ports. Component ports are visible as small rectangular images on the edges of components. Components may have IN, OUT and UNUSED ports. </span></span></p>
