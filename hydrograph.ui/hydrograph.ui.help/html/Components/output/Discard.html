<p><span><b>Discard</b>&nbsp;is just like a trash bin. It is present under the Output category in the component palette.</span></p>

<p><span>This component is used as container for waste data.  It has only one input port. </span></p>

<p><span>The Discard component can be easily distinguished in the component palette.</span></p>
