	<p><span>This component is used to writes a fixed width text file. It accepts the length for each record field from the user in
		the component properties and has a single input port. The execution fails if the accepted record field length does not match
		with the actual length.</p>
	<p><span>The Output File Fixed Width component can be easily distinguished in the component palette.</p>
