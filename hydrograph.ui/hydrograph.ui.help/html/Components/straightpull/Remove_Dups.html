<p><span><b>Remove Dups</b>&nbsp;is used to remove duplicates from an input source. It is present under the Straight Pull category in the component palette since no transformations are performed on the incoming data. </span></p>

<p><span>Remove Dups, removes duplicate records based on a key field and transmits the output through a single out port. Duplicate records are transmitted through a single unused port. </span></p>

<p><span>The Remove Dups component can be easily distinguished in the component palette.</span></p>
