<p><span><b>Union All</b>&nbsp;gathers records from one or more input sources into a single output. It is present under the Straight Pull category in the component palette since no transformations are performed on the incoming data.</span></p>

<p><span>Union All needs the schema of each of the input sources to be exactly same.The gathered data from each input source is transmitted via a single output port. It may contain two or more input ports and has no unused port on it. Also, the sort order is not maintained in the output records.</span></p>

<p><span>The Union All component can be easily distinguished in the component palette.</span></p>
