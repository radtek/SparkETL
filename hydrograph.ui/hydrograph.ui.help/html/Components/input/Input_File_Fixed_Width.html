		<span><b>Input File Fixed Width</b>&nbsp;as the name suggests accepts a fixed width file as input source and is present
			under the Input category in the component palette.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>This component is used to read a fixed width text file. It accepts the length for each record field from the user
			in the component properties and has a single output port. The execution fails if the accepted record field length does not
			match with the actual length.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>The Input File Fixed Width component can be easily distinguished in the component palette.</span>
